Pizza of Dublin

Lets cut through all the cheesness and let start talking about the best pizza of Dublin. What does it mean to have the best Pizza, Is it a thin light crispy base or is it a blended cow and bufflo motzrella these are the sort of questions that I will asking myself when rating. the rating system will be of course pizza themed (like all good things) with me being able to give up to 4 slices and the other 4 been given out on customer reviews from other sites one to one interactions.
