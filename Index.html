      My name is James Leahy, I am 28 from Ireland and have just recently
      moved to New Zealand (Windy Welly) to experience new challenges in design, photography, food and culture. This is what excites me and what I want to do more of.
      Having gone to such places like Istanbul, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and San Francisco. Allowing me to experiences the many unique cultures and people of the world. I have a passion for photography which can be seen on my instagram page. @JamesJam101
      I also manage and create content for a Instagram page that recommends the best places to eat (another hobby of mine) in Dublin called @wheretoeatdublin. Teaching me the importance of flexibility, time management and clear/good communication with a consumer.
      I am a kind, caring and ambitious person who loves to work as part of a team as it mean we succeed as a whole. But I do love working on a small personal project to create some independent work.
